# YoutubeDataHarvestingAndWarehousing
 This project gathers data from YouTube channels using the YouTube Data API, processes it, and stores it in a SQL data warehouse. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to enter a YouTube channel ID to fetch and store data. It also provides search capabilities to retrieve data from the SQL database.
